usage:
	
c0cp [options] idh idl filename bsz
c0cp 1234 56789 256KB-file 64

idh - Mero fid high
idl - Mero fid low
bsz - Clovis block size (in KiBs)

options are:
	-u | unit size (in KiBs, default 4),
	   | must be power of 2, >= 4 and <= 4096
	-f | force
	-p | performance
	-c | contiguous mode. 
	   | -c <n> write <n> contiguous copies of the file. 
	-x | pool ID. 
	   | -x <n> creates the object in pool with ID <n>. 
	
 The -f option forces rewriting on an object if that object already exists. 
 It creates a new object if the object does not exist.
 c0cp -f 1234 56789 256MB-file 8096 -u 1024
	
 The -p option enables performance monitoring. It collects performance parameters
 such as bandwidth and displays them at the end of the execution.It also outputs 
 realtime storage bandwith consumption.
 c0cp -p 1234 56789 256MB-file 8096 -u 1024
	
 The -c <n> option takes <n> a positive number as an argument and creates an 
 object with <n> contiguous copies of the same file.
 c0cp -c 10 1234 56789 256MB-file 8096 -u 1024

 The -x option takes <n> a positive number as an argument and selects the pool
 with ID <n> for creating the object. Without this option objects are created
 in the default pool.
 c0cp -x 3 1234 56789 256MB-file 8096 -u 1024

 Note: to get maximum performance block_size should be unit_size * units_number
 in the parity group configuration of the pool. For example, in 8+2 parity
 configuration (8 data + 2 parity units in the group) and 1MiB unit size -
 block_size should be 8MiB.
